### A pitch-black marble maze made in Unreal Engine

LightMaze lets the player navigate a pitch-black randomly-generated maze with a glowing marble as the only light source. The player can drop some of their light on the ground to mark parts of the maze, but lose some of their own light when they do.

This was a learning project to get accustomed to working in Unreal Engine, particularly as a first experiment using node-based programming. I decided to put together a maze generation algorithm in Blueprints to make things challenging and see how far I could push it. I took the light mechanics from a bigger game idea I had been thinking about, so the project doubles as a partial proof of concept.
