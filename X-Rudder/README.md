# X-Rudder
A simple game in which two players attempt to form a 3x3 X pattern on a board to win. Players can block each other's attempts by placing and moving tokens on both sides of an opponent X's central token. Implements a game AI that uses a search tree and a minmax algorithm with an optimized version of alpha-beta pruning with the working restriction that the AI must respond within 5 seconds of the human player's input.

Developed as part of Nora Houari's COMP 472 - Artificial Intelligence at Concordia University in the fall of 2019.
